# Assignment: Browser Comparison Agent + Replay Viewer

> EAG V3 — Session 9 (Browser Agents & Autonomous Web)

Build a browser-capable agent that completes a real comparison task on the web and produces a replay view of the run.

The goal is to demonstrate work that Session 8's `web_search` + `fetch_url` cannot reliably do: interacting with dynamic pages, filters, dropdowns, tabs, search forms, product cards, pricing pages, or multi-step workflows. `web_search` and `fetch_url` are useful for static pages, but they fail on JavaScript-rendered pages, click-revealed widgets, multi-page flows, and sites where useful data appears only after filtering or sorting.

## The task

Students must choose **one comparison task**, such as:

- Compare 3 laptops under ₹80,000.
- Compare 5 AI coding tools by free plan and paid plan.
- Compare top 3 Hugging Face text-generation models sorted by likes.
- Compare 5 CNC/VMC training institutes in Bangalore.

The agent must perform at least **three visible browser actions**, such as search, filter, sort, open product/detail pages, switch tabs, expand hidden content, or submit a form. **Passive scraping from search snippets is not accepted.**

## Required output

The final output must include a structured comparison table and a replay viewer/report showing:

1. Original user goal
2. Planner DAG
3. Browser path chosen: extract / deterministic / a11y / vision / blocked
4. Browser actions taken
5. Screenshots or page-state logs
6. Extracted data
7. Final comparison table
8. Turn count and cost summary

## Constraints

The orchestrator must not be modified. Any new behavior must plug in through the skill catalogue or as a Browser skill extension.

## Reference pipeline

```
User Goal
  → Planner
  → Researcher          (find candidate URLs)
  → Browser Skill       (interact with website)
  → Cheapest correct path?
      ├─ Extract        (static page)
      ├─ Deterministic  (CSS selectors)
      ├─ A11y           (accessibility tree)
      ├─ Vision         (set-of-marks)
      └─ Gateway Blocked (recover or report)
  → Distiller
  → QA / Critic
  → Replay Viewer
  → Final Comparison Table
```

## Submission

YouTube demo, GitHub repo, replay trace/log, final comparison output, and a short architecture note.
